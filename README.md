# lourdes
An easy-to-use lightweighted sparkling boost-based C++ miscellaneous library.

## The whys

### Why easy-to-use?
Because it is namespace-based and well organized to let you avoid spending time
in compiling it and understanding how to use it.

### Why lightweighted?
Source code is minimal, as well as the header files. Only the .cpp files contain
dependencies to the boost library. The header files don't.

### Why sparkling?
Feel free to use it. Add the source files in your project source files, or
compile it as a library, or use just those files you need. Do whatever you want!

### Why boost-based?
Because I love boost, and I miss it.

### Why miscellaneous?
In my personal projects and previous jobs I always had to implement the same
classes and methods for the most typical tasks I needed as a programmer. One day
I said I should start a library which contains all this stuff. Here it is.

### But... why lourdes?
Because I love C++, and I love boost, and I miss both.

### Emm... again, but why lourdes?
Because Lourdes is the name of a very lovely special woman.
